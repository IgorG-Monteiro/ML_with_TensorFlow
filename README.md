# Machine Learning with Python - TensorFlow

This repository contains code, exercises and personal notes from the [FreeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python (TensorFlow)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/tensorflow/) course. It serves as a reference for learning and practicing machine learning concepts using TensorFlow.

## üìå Course Overview

This course covers fundamental concepts in machine learning and deep learning, using TensorFlow to build and train models. Topics include:
- TensorFlow Basics
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Reinforcement Learning

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To run the code in this repository, ensure you have the following installed: 
(When in Windows, I recommend to run in a WSL environment)
- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow {and-cuda}
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- All [requirements](requirements.txt)

## üìñ Additional Resources
